# loops-workshop-2017-talk
Slides for my talk at the [8th Coronal Loops Workshop (2017)](http://www.astropa.unipa.it/CLW2017/CLW2017.html) in Palermo, Italy

## Goal
Highlight observable differences between nanoflare heating models with different frequencies (if they exist) using EBTEL and a global active region model. We will primarily rely on the LOS emission measure distribution constructed from EIS line intensities and associated slopes for making determinations about the underlying heating frequency. We may also look at the time lags in each pixel of the entire active region as well as the measured line widths and doppler shifts (though these are secondary).
